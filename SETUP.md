# Repository Setup

This repository is configured for GitHub remote operations.

## Current Configuration

- **Remote**: origin → https://github.com/Flaasks/SanValentino.git
- **Branches**: 
  - `main` - Primary branch (ready to push)
  - `copilot/push-main-branch-to-origin` - Development branch

## Push Main Branch to Origin

The repository is now ready. You can push the main branch to origin with:

```bash
git checkout main
git push -u origin main
```

Note: The remote 'origin' is already configured, so `git remote add origin` is not needed.
